# FarcasterDAO
Empowering the decentralized social network revolution with the Farcaster DAO.
|
Farcaster DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that aims to support and expand the Farcaster protocol, a decentralized social network built on the Ethereum blockchain. The DAO provides a way for the Farcaster community to collectively govern the protocol's development and direction, giving users a voice in shaping the future of this decentralized social network.
By leveraging the power of a DAO, Farcaster DAO addresses the challenges of centralized social media platforms, which often lack transparency, user control, and equitable distribution of value. The DAO model empowers the Farcaster community to make decisions, allocate resources, and drive the protocol's evolution, fostering a more democratic and user-centric social network.
